Look in the [slim/README.md](./slim/README.md) for the documentation of this image or in [legacy/README.md](./legacy/README.md) for the legacy image.

***NB:** Currently the legacy image is still the default, but the slim image is recommended for new deployments. The legacy image will be removed in a future release.*
